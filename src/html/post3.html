                <h1>Begin considering your design system</h1>
                <p>This is really 2a, but doing a first draft of your webpages can help you take the first steps toward the design
                    system. You don't need to build the page out yet, but hopefully drawing these pages has you thinking more in-depth
                    on how everything should look. If you want some ideas, you can also check out Veritas, Udacity's design system
                    (yours does not need to be anywhere near as detailed).</p>
